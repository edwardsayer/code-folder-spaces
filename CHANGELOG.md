# Changelog

All notable changes to Folder Spaces are documented in this file.

## [0.0.1] — 2026-10-08

### Added

- Initial project scaffold: extension manifest, build (esbuild), TypeScript config, unit tests (Vitest) and project health gate.
- Configuration model `codeFolderSpaces.spaces` with string or object entries, variable interpolation (`${workspaceFolder}`, `${workspaceFolders[N]}`, `${userHome}`), per-space name, icon, `showFiles`, `include` and `exclude`.
- Dedicated activity-bar container and `codeFolderSpaces.explorer` tree view.
- Folder-scoped tree over `workspace.fs` with directories-first ordering, optional files and glob filtering.
- Commands: add space, remove space, refresh, reveal active file.
- Recursive file system watchers per space with debounced refresh.
- Two-layer localization files (`package.nls.*`, `l10n/bundle.l10n.*`) for English and Traditional Chinese.
- Public API exported from `activate()` (`version`, `getSpaces()`).
